# Brownian Motion Simulation

This project is a web application that simulates Brownian motion, demonstrating the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid. The simulation is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To run the Brownian motion simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd brownian-motion-web
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   If you have npm installed, run the following command to install any required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Open the application**:
   Open `src/index.html` in your web browser to view the simulation.

## Features

- Visual representation of Brownian motion using animated particles.
- Customizable parameters for particle size, speed, and number of particles.
